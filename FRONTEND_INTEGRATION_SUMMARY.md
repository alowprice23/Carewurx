   - Comprehensive unit test coverage
   - End-to-end test validation
   - Mocking strategies for external dependencies

### Key Integration Points
1. **Electron IPC Bridge**
   - Complete mapping of backend capabilities
   - Transparent error handling
   - Promise-based interface

2. **Real-Time Updates**
   - Event-based notification system
   - Subscription/unsubscription lifecycle management
   - UI updates on data changes

3. **Agentic Integration**
   - Agent conversation management
   - Opportunity scanning automation
   - Groq API connection (backend side)

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Universal Schedule UI**
   - This is the highest priority remaining item
   - Will enable core scheduling functionality
   - Requires integration with calendar component

2. **Implement Groq API Integration UI**
   - Will provide control over agent capabilities
   - Important for customization and monitoring
   - Enhances agentic capabilities

3. **Complete Agent Insight Display**
   - Will provide contextual insights from agents
   - Important for decision making
   - Enhances value proposition of agents

## Conclusion
The frontend integration has made significant progress with the implementation of the core service layer and essential UI components. The remaining work focuses on more advanced features and specialized UI components, building upon the solid foundation that has been established.

The C=2πr circular integration model is being successfully implemented through the Universal Schedule Service, and the agentic capabilities are operational through the Agent Service and UI components. The 30-minute automated opportunity scanning feature has been implemented in the Opportunity Scanner component.

With the completed features, users can now interact with Lexxi and Bruce agents, view and manage opportunities, and receive notifications through an enhanced notification system - addressing the key requirements specified in the integration plan.
